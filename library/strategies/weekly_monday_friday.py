"""
Weekly Monday-Friday Strategy.

This strategy implements a simple weekly trading pattern:
- BUY on the first business day of the week (Monday, or Tuesday if Monday is holiday)
- SELL on Friday of the same week
- Stay flat over weekends

Strategy Logic:
- On Monday (or first business day): Open long position
- On Friday: Close long position
- Between Tuesday-Thursday: Hold position
- Weekends: Flat (no position)

Key Features:
- Calendar-based timing strategy
- Uses Python's datetime for weekday detection
- Simple hold period (Monday to Friday)
- Demonstrates event-driven position management
